# KeyLogger
This file implements a global keylogger for Windows using Node.js. It captures all keyboard input system-wide, logs keystrokes, tracks the active window, and takes a screenshot each time the user presses Enter or Tab. The script then saves these logs and screenshots in organized folders and sends them via email using Nodemailer.
